# Contributing Guide

Guidelines for contributing to the CEO Portfolio Platform. This document outlines the development workflow, code standards, and contribution process to ensure consistent quality and maintainability.

## Development Workflow

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**
   ```bash
   # Fork the repository on GitHub
   # Clone your fork locally
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ceo.dev.git
   cd ceo.dev
   ```

2. **Set Up Development Environment**
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   npm install

   # Set up environment variables
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with development values
   ```

3. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   # Create and checkout feature branch
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Branch Naming Convention

Use descriptive branch names that clearly indicate the purpose:

```bash
# Feature branches
feature/add-contact-form-validation
feature/improve-responsive-navigation
feature/fix-accessibility-issues

# Bug fix branches
bugfix/correct-typo-in-about-section
bugfix/resolve-form-submission-error

# Documentation branches
docs/update-api-reference
docs/add-component-examples

# Refactor branches
refactor/extract-form-validation-logic
refactor/optimize-bundle-size
```

**Branch Naming Rules:**
- Use lowercase with hyphens as separators
- Start with category prefix: `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`
- Include brief description of the change
- Avoid generic names like `fix`, `update`, or `changes`

## Commit Standards

### Commit Message Format

Use conventional commits for consistent commit history:

```bash
# Format: type(scope): description

# Examples
feat(components): add new contact form component
fix(forms): resolve validation error for email field
docs(readme): update installation instructions
refactor(navigation): simplify component structure
perf(images): optimize loading with responsive sizes
style(css): standardize spacing in component files
test(forms): add unit tests for form validation
```

### Commit Types

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **feat** | New feature | `feat(auth): add user login system` |
| **fix** | Bug fix | `fix(forms): correct validation error` |
| **docs** | Documentation | `docs(api): update endpoint documentation` |
| **refactor** | Code restructuring | `refactor(layout): simplify component hierarchy` |
| **perf** | Performance improvement | `perf(images): optimize loading strategy` |
| **style** | Code style changes | `style(css): format component styles` |
| **test** | Test additions/modifications | `test(forms): add validation tests` |
| **chore** | Maintenance tasks | `chore(deps): update package dependencies` |

### Commit Guidelines

1. **Atomic Commits**: Each commit should represent a single logical change
2. **Descriptive Messages**: Use imperative mood ("add feature" not "added feature")
3. **Scope**: Include scope when the change affects specific components or features
4. **Line Length**: Keep commit messages under 72 characters for subject line
5. **Body**: Add detailed description for complex changes

```bash
# Good commit message
feat(forms): add email validation with real-time feedback

Add client-side email validation with visual feedback indicators.
Users now see validation errors immediately upon input blur.
Includes comprehensive test coverage for edge cases.

# Poor commit message
update stuff
```
