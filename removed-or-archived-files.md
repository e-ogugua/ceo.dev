# Removed or Archived Files

This document tracks files that have been moved to the archive folder during the refactoring process. These files can be restored if needed.

## Archived Files

### Phase A: Image Optimization (2025-10-21)

**15 large PNG/JPEG images were moved to archive** during the image optimization process:

#### Original Images Archived (52MB total)
```

```

**Rationale**: These original large images were converted to optimized WebP/AVIF formats for better performance. The optimized versions are 95% smaller while maintaining visual quality.

**Impact**: Reduced total image directory from 100MB to 4.9MB (95% reduction)

**Restoration Commands**:
```bash
# Restore all original images
cp archive/images/2025-10-21/* public/images/

# Restore specific image
cp archive/images/2025-10-21/EmmdraLogo.png public/images/EmmdraLogo.png

# Remove optimized versions if rolling back completely
rm -rf public/images/optimized/
```

### Previous Refactoring (Pre-Phase A)

No files have been moved to the archive folder yet. During this refactoring process, we focused on:

1. Externalizing hardcoded content from components to JSON files
2. Optimizing configuration files
3. Adding new utility files for better code organization

## Future Archive Candidates

The following types of files may be candidates for archiving in future refactoring phases:

### Unused Dependencies
- Old package versions in node_modules (handled by package manager)
- Unused development dependencies

### Build Artifacts
- .next/ folder (auto-generated during builds)
- dist/ folder (if using different build system)
- build/ folder (legacy build outputs)

### Temporary Files
- *.log files (application logs)
- *.tmp files (temporary files)
- coverage/ folder (test coverage reports)

### Documentation Files
- CHANGELOG.md (if outdated)
- CONTRIBUTING.md (if project structure changed significantly)

## Archive Restoration Process

To restore archived files:

1. Check Archive Location:
   ```bash
   ls -la archive/
   ```

2. Restore Specific File:
   ```bash
   # Move file back to original location
   mv archive/filename.ext src/components/filename.ext

   # Or copy if you want to keep archived version
   cp archive/filename.ext src/components/filename.ext
   ```

3. Verify Restoration:
   - Check file permissions
   - Verify imports still work
   - Run tests if applicable

4. Update Documentation:
   - Remove from this archived files list
   - Update any references in documentation

## Archive Management Policy

### When to Archive
- Files no longer referenced in codebase
- Unused configuration files
- Outdated documentation
- Temporary or cache files

### When NOT to Archive
- Source code files (components, utilities, pages)
- Active configuration files
- Current documentation
- Test files

### Archive Organization
```
archive/
├── unused-components/
├── old-configs/
├── deprecated-docs/
└── temp-files/
```

## Files NOT Archived (Intentionally Kept)

The following files were considered but kept for the following reasons:

### src/components/ArticleContent.tsx
- Reason: Refactored to use external data, still actively used
- Size: Reduced from ~51KB to ~8KB after refactoring

### src/components/BlogPostContent.tsx
- Reason: Refactored to use external data, still actively used
- Size: Reduced from ~36KB to ~8KB after refactoring

### next.config.js
- Reason: Enhanced with performance optimizations, still required
- Changes: Added bundle analyzer, improved image optimization

### package.json
- Reason: Updated with new scripts and dependencies, still required
- Changes: Added bundle analyzer script, updated dependencies

## Performance Impact

### Before Refactoring
- ArticleContent.tsx: 51,740 bytes (51KB)
- BlogPostContent.tsx: 36,674 bytes (36KB)
- Total Component Size: ~88KB of hardcoded content

### After Refactoring
- ArticleContent.tsx: ~8KB (uses external data)
- BlogPostContent.tsx: ~8KB (uses external data)
- New JSON Files: ~15KB total
- New Utility Files: ~3KB total
- Net Reduction: ~62KB of inline code

## Benefits of Current Approach

1. Maintainability: Content separated from presentation logic
2. Performance: Smaller initial bundle sizes
3. SEO: Content can be statically generated
4. Flexibility: Easy to add CMS integration later
5. Developer Experience: Clear separation of concerns

## Future Considerations

In future refactoring phases, consider archiving:

1. Test Files: If moving to different testing framework
2. Old Components: If completely replaced by new implementations
3. Legacy Configuration: If using new build tools
4. Outdated Documentation: If creating new docs from scratch

## Archive Changelog

### v1.0.0 - Initial Refactoring (Current)
- Date: October 2025
- Changes: Externalized hardcoded content to JSON files
- Files Affected: ArticleContent.tsx, BlogPostContent.tsx
- Size Reduction: ~62KB of inline code moved to external files

### Future Versions
- Track additional archiving activities here
- Document reasons for archiving
- Note any breaking changes

## Questions for Future Review

1. Content Management: Should we implement a CMS for article management?
2. Build Optimization: Can we further reduce bundle sizes?
3. Component Splitting: Should we split more large components?
4. Archive Strategy: What's our long-term archive management strategy?
